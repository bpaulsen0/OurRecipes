              <p>Black Cat Coffee remains one of Tia's favorite spots to visit very time we make it back to Ashland to 
                visit our family. Here we spent hours together before we had started dating while we tried in vain to 
                complete a calculus problem that turned out to be impossible to solve. Over the five hours that we spent 
                trying to tackle our homework we shared many laughs and this is where our relationship began.</p>

              <p>Tia being on the Ski Team and me being on the Snowboarding Team, we spent hundreds of hours on this small ski 
                hill training and spending time with eachother. I have always said that the chair lift was the slowest lift but 
                when we were able to time our runs and ride up together, that lift was far too fast.</p>

                The water will be too cold for any swimming at the time of our wedding, but it is still a gorgeous hike and a great way to fill an afternoon.</p>

                had discussed being a perfect spot for a proposal. After finding the perfect ring and convincing her very subtly to 
                wear something nice, I was able to pull off the perfect surprise.</p>
